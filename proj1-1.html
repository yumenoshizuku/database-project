<h3><br></h3><h3>Summary of Deadlines</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>The next couple of days:</b> Find a
team-mate.</li>
<li><strong>Monday June 3 - Tuesday June 4</strong><b>:</b> Meet with a TA to discuss your application and
design and get approval. <b> This is a required meeting.</b></li>
<li><strong></strong><b>Thursday June 6, at the begining of class: </b>Submit a hard-copy with your final project description. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Please check the <a href="../hwproj_info.html">Project Lateness Policy</a>
<strong> </strong>carefully. For Part 1 of Project 1,
you can <b>only</b> use project grace days for the final
hard-copy submission (i.e., you <b>cannot</b> use grace
days to delay your meeting with a TA).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Teams</h3>
<p>You will carry out this project in <strong>teams of two</strong>.
If you can't find a team-mate,
please follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Post a <a href="https://courseworks.columbia.edu/" target="_top">message in the class discussion board</a>
on CourseWorks asking for a team mate - <strong>the best way</strong>.
In the message, you may want to provide a one-line description of what
you may want to do (or, simply that you are open to ideas), the option
you want to follow for Part 3 of this project (see below "Overview of
Project 1"), or any other information you may find useful for your
potential future teammate to know.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Send email to a TA <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><strong></strong>who may know another student without a
team-mate.</li>
</ol>
<p>You do not need to notify us of your team composition.
Instead,
when you submit the first part of your project you should
indicate in your submission your team composition.</p><p>Important notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you decide to drop the class, or are even remotely
considering doing so, please be considerate and <strong>notify
your team-mate immediately</strong>. </li>
<li>On a related note, do not wait until the day before the
deadline to start working on the project, just to realize then that
your team-mate has dropped the class or moved to another planet. It is
your responsibility to start working on the project and spot any
problems with your team-mate early on.</li>
<li>You might be able to do the project by yourself if you have
a compelling reason, but we strongly discourage this.&nbsp;This is
a large class, and we are relatively understaffed, so we simply cannot
handle a large number of individual projects. If you want to do the
project by yourself, you should get <strong>explicit permission </strong>
by email from the instructor: in your email give a compelling reason
why you want to work by yourself.
<ul>
<li>Not knowing other people in the class is <strong>not</strong>
a compelling reason, and you should use the discussion board&nbsp;to help you find a team-mate. (See above.) </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Please check the <font color="#000000"><a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/honesty" target="_top">policies and procedures regarding academic
honesty</a> </font> for important information of what
kinds of collaboration are allowed for projects.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Computer accounts</h3>
<p>You will need a <strong>CS account</strong> to do
the final parts of Project 1 (not for Part 1, though) but only if you
decide to do the project on Unix. (You will not need a CS account if
you do your project fully on your laptop.) Consequently, if you
use Unix, then at least one of the team members should have a CS
account. If neither of you have a CS account, please
open one from <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/%7Ecrf/accounts/cs.html" target="_top">https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~crf/accounts/cs.html</a>.
Choose the appropriate "student" category as the "account type." There
is a $50 charge to open a CS account. Please refer to <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/%7Ecrf/" target="_top">CRF's
homepage</a> for
details on infrastructure and policies of the CS department.</p>
<h3><a name="Overview_of_Project_1"></a>Overview of Project 1</h3>
<p>In Project 1, you will build a substantial real-world database
application of your choice. You will do the conceptual design of
the database on paper <strong>in Part 1,</strong> and then
you will
create an actual database on Oracle <strong>in Part 2</strong>.&nbsp;
<b>Part 3
</b>requires some explanation, because you will have two options
on how to complete it: <b>(3.a) Web Front-End Option </b>or
<b>(3.b) Expanded-Design Option</b>: </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Option 3.a:</b> If you follow the <b>Web
Front-End Option</b> (<b><font color="#ff0000">which
is the most fun option!</font></b>) for Part 3 of the
project, you will write an application (in PHP or Java: your choice)
that manipulates the database through
updates and queries, through a simple web front-end.</li>
<li><b>Option 3.b:</b> If, instead, you decide to
follow the <b> Expanded-Design Option </b>for Part 3 of
the project, you will substantially expand your database design from
Part 1 (see guidelines below), without having to develop a web
front-end and hence with no programming needed. You will also have to
incorporate this expanded design into your Oracle database of Part 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, Parts 2 and 3 will be based on your description and
design of Part 1.</p>
<p>Pick an application that you will enjoy working with, since
you will be stuck with it for a substantial part of the semester! A
suggestion is that you build a database about something that you are
interested in --a hobby, a favorite web site, material from another
course, a research project, etc. It's especially nice if you pick an
application where you can populate your database using real, as opposed
to fabricated, data. As the project progresses, you'll end up creating
a database of at least dozens of entities/relationships. If you have an
application where you can get a large amount
of real data to populate your database, all the better, but it's not
necessary.</p><h3>Overview of Part 1 of Project 1</h3>
<p>For <strong>Part 1</strong> of this project,
which you should
submit <strong>in hard copy</strong>, you should include <b>3
items</b>:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>(Required) Detailed description of your
application: </b>You will describe the
general "domain" of your application, construct an
Entity-Relationship diagram for the database, and map it to a
relational schema using the mapping technique that we will cover in
class. <br>
<br>
Try to pick an application with a schema that is relatively
substantial, but not too large. As general guidelines:<br>
&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>If you are doing the project in a team of two (which
should be the general case), your E/R design should have around seven
entity sets and a similar number of relationship sets. This is a
ballpark figure only: something in the 5-to-10 range should be fine.
You will get a sense if your design is too simple or too complex.
Please talk with a TA <strong>during office hours</strong>
if you are in doubt about this. </li>
<li>If you are doing the project by yourself (you need
explicit permission; see above), your E/R design should have around
five entity sets and a similar number of relationship sets. This is a
ballpark figure only: something in the 3-to-7 range should be fine. You
will get a sense if your design is too simple or too complex. Please
talk with a TA <strong>during office hours</strong> if you
are in doubt about this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try to make your application interesting, including a
variety
of different kinds of attribute domains (e.g., strings, integers,
etc.) and relationships (i.e., with different key and
participation constraints). It is important that you include as
many relevant constraints for your application from the real
world as possible in your E/R diagram.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li><b>(Required) Your choice for Part 3 of the project: </b>As
part of your Part 1 submission, you need to specify whether you will
follow the <b>Web Front-End Option </b> (Option 3.a) or
the <b>Expanded-Design Option</b> (Option 3.b) for Part 3
of the project (see above).<br>
&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>If you will follow the Web Front-End Option, then you
should simply say so with your Part 1 submission. In this case, you do
not need to include any additional information regarding Part 3 with
your Part 1 submission.</li>
<li>If you will follow the Expanded-Design Option <b>or
if you are not sure at this point</b>, then you should state this
in your Part 1 submission, as well as <b>specify how you will
expand your design in Part 3</b>. The expansion of your project
in Part 3 should augment your project --in terms of the number of
entity sets, relationship sets, and overall "complexity" of the
design-- <b>roughly by an additional 50%</b>. This
expansion should be substantial: rather than just adding a few entity
sets and relationship sets that are overly similar to those in Part 1
of the project, you are expected to add a truly novel and significant
component to your database. (See below for more guidelines.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you state in Part 1 that you will follow the
Expanded-Design Option, it is OK for you to change your mind and decide
to follow the Web Front-End Option later, when we announce Part 3 of
the project; however, if you do <b> not</b> submit a plan
for the Expanded-Design Option when you submit Part 1 of the project,
then you will have no choice and you will have to follow the Web
Front-End Option; we will make <b>no exceptions</b> to
this rule.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li><strong>(Optional but strongly recommended)
Contingency plan for two-person teams: </strong>Since
students do occasionally drop classes, and to prevent last-minute
surprises, we suggest that you also include in your submission a <strong>"contingency
plan"</strong> for the unfortunate case in which one of the
team-mates drops the class later in the semester. This
contingency plan should indicate how you will "downgrade"
the project to a simpler one in such a case <b>--including in
Part 3, if you follow the Expanded-Design Option--</b>, so that
it is
appropriate for a single person to complete. (See guidelines for
single-person projects above.) If your team-mate drops the class,
rather than finding a new team-mate to complete the project,
which is problematic for a number of reasons, you will complete
the "downgraded" version of your original project.
Including such a contingency plan is <strong>optional</strong>,
but if you choose not to submit it when you submit Part 1 and
your team-mate drops the class later, you will have to complete
the original project as planned, and <strong>no exceptions</strong>
will be made at that point.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="What_you_need_to_do_for_Part_1"></a>What you need to do for Part 1</h3>
<ol>
<li>Find a <strong>team-mate.</strong> There's no
need to notify us of this; you will simply indicate who your team-mate
is when you submit Part 1. </li>
<li>If you will do the project on <b>Unix</b>
machines, get a <strong>CS account</strong> if neither you
nor your team-mate has one.</li>
<li>Decide on an application for your project and:<br>
&nbsp;
<ul>
<li><strong>Write a relatively informal,
one-paragraph description of the application</strong><b>,
not to exceed 20 lines or so</b>, highlighting interesting and
challenging parts. If you're having trouble thinking of an application,
take a look at any web shopping site (e.g., <a href="http://www.amazon.com" target="_top">Amazon</a>).
They all have a similar theme: products, customers, orders, shopping
baskets, etc., and typically make for an interesting and appropriately
sized application. (You can ignore all "security"-related issues (e.g.,
user authentication, encryption) in your application.) The more
concrete your written description, the more efficient and useful the
meeting with the class staff will be (see below). This paragraph should
include:
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li>A high-level description of the general domain of
the application. If you will follow the Web Front-End Option for Part
3, you should also provide specific details as to how users will
interact with it. For example, if your application is somehow inspired
in the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/" target="_top">Internet
Movie Database</a>, your description should describe the general
"entities" that are involved, plus explain that your application might
ask users for a movie title and return as a result the actors in the
movie; you might also let users store in the database the fact that
they liked certain movies and disliked others; finally, given a userid,
your application might give recommendations on the movies that the user
might like, given the user's previously recorded preferences, according
to some simple "recommendation" algorithm.</li>
<li>An idea of what entities and relationship sets you
will have, including attributes and constraints. You don't need to have
your design completely finalized, though, but of course it will help if
you bring to the meeting at least a <b>preliminary
entity/relationship diagram</b>, so we encourage you to do so.</li>
<li>An idea of <b>what data you will use</b>
to populate your database later on.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If you will follow the <b>Expanded-Design Option</b>
for Part 3 of the project, <b>write a relatively informal,
one-paragraph description of how you will expand your design in Part 3,
not to exceed 20 lines or so</b>. As discussed above, the
expansion of your project in Part 3 should augment your project --in
terms of the number of entity sets, relationship sets, and overall
"complexity" of the design-- roughly by 50%. As discussed above, this
expansion should be substantial: rather than just adding a few entity
sets and relationship sets that are overly similar to those in Part 1
of the project, you are expected to add a truly novel and significant
component to your database (following the above "50% increase in
complexity" guidelines). For example, if your Part 1 database follows
some variant of the Amazon web shopping site, a substantial expansion
for Part 3 could be the addition of a sophisticated "subsystem" for
product reviews and ratings, as well as for allowing users to vote on
the usefulness of the reviews from other customers, etc. If you will
follow the <b>Web Front-End Option</b> in Part 3, then you
do not need to write anything for Part 3 at this point.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Write a short description of your contingency
plan</b> (see above).<br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Meet with a TA on Monday June 3 - Tuesday June 4</strong><b> </b>to
discuss your design and make sure that it is appropriate (i.e.,
challenging enough, but not unrealistically so). <strong>This
meeting is required </strong>and should last <strong>about
five minutes. </strong>Your grade for Part 1 will be decreased
substantially if you don't meet with any of the class staff. We will
have <strong>expanded office hours</strong> during that
week that you will be able to see on the class website. Please show up early in the week to minimize delays. We will <strong>not
</strong>be taking appointments, so please show up directly
during office hours. <font color="#ff0000"><b>Both
team members should attend the meeting, at the same time.</b></font>
<strong>For this meeting, bring the written materials
described in the previous point (i.e., in item (3)).</strong> </li>
<li>After a TA has OKed your general application, your plans
for Part 3, and your contingency plan, modify your description based on
the feedback that you were given, and write an <strong>E/R
diagram</strong> (following the syntax that we saw in class) of
your database, specifying as many of the real-world constraints for
your application as possible. <b><br>
<br>
Important note if you follow the Expanded-Design Option for Part 3:</b>
in Part 1, you do not need to write or submit an E/R diagram for your
Part 3 expanded design; instead, you should just submit the
one-paragraph description of your expansion plans for Part 3, which you
should have brought to the meeting with a TA and <b>gotten
approved during the meeting</b>. You will do the E/R diagram,
etc. for Part 3, later in the semester.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Using the methods that we will have covered in class, map
your E/R diagram into a <strong>relational schema in SQL</strong>,
capturing as many of the E/R constraints (e.g., key and participation
constraints) as possible. </li>
<li>Submit a <strong>hard copy</strong> of <strong>(a)</strong>
your one-paragraph description of the application (which you should
have revised based on the feedback from your meeting with one of the
class staff), <strong>(b)</strong> your E/R diagram, <strong>(c)
</strong>your resulting SQL schema, <b>(d) </b>your
one-paragraph description of your expansion plans for Part 3, if you
are following the Expanded-Design Option (which you should have revised
based on the feedback from your meeting with one of the class staff),
and <b>(e)</b> your contingency plan (again, revised as
appropriate based on your meeting with one of the class staff). You
should submit all these materials at the beginning of class <strong>(</strong><b>1:10pm
for Section 1, 4:10pm for Section 2</b><strong>) on
Wednesday February </strong><span style="font-weight: bold;">20</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Keep a copy</strong> of all these
materials for yourselves, since you will need them for Parts 2 and 3 of
the project.</li>
</ol>
<p><b><u>Important note:</u> </b>Try
to <b>meet with a TA as early as possible</b><strong></strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="Grading_for_Part_1"></a>Grading for Part 1</h3>
<p>Your grade for Part 1 of Project 1 will be split as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Meeting with class staff: 7 points.</strong><br>
If you come to the meeting prepared with your written description as
specified in items (3) and (4) above, you can expect to get all points,
even if you are asked to make changes or revisions to your proposal.</li>
<li><strong>Quality of final one-paragraph description of
your application: 6 points.</strong><br>
We will evaluate the overall quality of your final hard-copy
one-paragraph description of your application, especially in terms of
how thoroughly you incorporated any revisions suggested during your
meeting with the class staff.</li>
<li><strong>Quality of E/R diagram: 6 points.</strong><br>
We will evaluate how well your E/R diagram models your proposed
application, including how well you modeled any relevant real-world
constraints.</li>
<li><strong>Quality of your SQL schema: 6 points.</strong><br>
We will evaluate how well you mapped your E/R diagram, including
constraints, into a SQL schema using the technique that we covered in
class.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="faq">Frequently-asked questions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Q: I have a really cool idea for Project 1,
but in order to implement it I would have to work alone. Can I?<br>
A: </strong>Unfortunately this is not a "compelling" enough
reason for a one-person team. Please modify your project idea so that
it becomes appropriate for a two-person team.</li>
<li><strong>Q: Can my team have 3 (or 4, or 12) students
for Project 1?<br>
A: </strong>No, your team has to have exactly two students
(unless you get explicit permission from the instructor for a
one-person team; see above).</li>
<li><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>Why use
Oracle for Parts 2 and 3 of Project 1? Can I use my favorite DBMS
instead?</strong><br>
<strong>A: </strong>As much as we would like to be
more flexible, we just don't have the staff to handle several diverse
systems and platforms. Unfortunately, you cannot use any other DBMS.</li>
<li><strong>Q: Can I use&nbsp;some other programming language
other than PHP or Java for the Part 3 Web Front-End Option of Project
1?<br>
A: </strong>Please see the answer to the previous question.</li>
